<!--more-->

## Ingredients
- Chicken breast
- Soy sauce
- Thina (raw sesame paste)
- Lemon
- Sesame oil
- Pistachio paste
- Teryaki sauce
- Silan (date honey)
- Salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, oregano
- Maggie (yeast sauce)
- Worcester sauce
- Olive Oil

## How to make it
1. In a big bowl, mix all the ingredients into a watery-pasty consistency. You can add/remove any ingredient, and the amounts are to your taste :)
2. Put the chicken in the bowl, mix it a bit so the sauce goes everywhere, and cover it with sauce. You can add a little bit of water if needed, but not too much.
3. Cover it with plastic paper and leave it for the night (the longer the better up to 12 hours. you can also leave it in the fridge)
4. Preheat oven to 180-210 degrees.
5. Put the chicken in a pyrex container, and cover the chicken with all of the "mole". Cover with aluminum foil.
6. Cook the chicken for about 45-60 minutes, until it is cooked well from inside (you can make a small cut in the fattest part to check)
7. When it's ready, lift remove the aluminum foil for a few minutes (~5m), but not too much so that the sauce doesn't burn.

Enjoy!
