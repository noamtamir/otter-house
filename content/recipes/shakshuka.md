## Ingredients
- 4 Tomatoes
- 1 Onion
- 4 Garlic cloves
- 1 Red pepper - sweet, medium size (optional)
- 1/2 Jalapeño (optional)
- Spices: salt, pepper, paprika (sweet and spicy)
- Fresh cilantro or parsley
- 6 Eggs

## How to make it
1. Cut all the vegetables into cubes
2. Fry the onion until it is clear, using a big wide pan
3. Add the garlic
4. After 3 mins or so, add the red pepper
5. When the pepper starts to soften add the tomatoes.
6. Add the spices, to your taste (including the Jalapeño). If you wish you can add some of the fresh cilantro/parsley.
7. Cook on low fire (to avoid burning) for about 20 mins, until the it become more like a sauce. Some people prefer the consistency more like a sauce, and some more chunky. The longer you cook it, the softer it will be.
8. With a spoon "move" a little bit of the sauce to make room for an egg, and break an egg into the hole. Repeat for all eggs. Put as many as you wish.
9. Cook until the eggs are ready to your taste (runny / hard). To cook faster, cover the pan.
10. Add a little bit of salt/pepper and fresh cilantro/parsley on top of the eggs for beauty and extra flavour.
11. Enjoy!
